# Final Project
Machine Learning | Spring 2025

## Milestone 02: On Process
Continue working on thesis [Images Files](https://github.com/monsichasris/thesis/tree/main/public/street_view_images) from google street view<br>
Try to detect the sign from the images [Zero-shot object detection model on Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13NEVTO0-jVZzd8Inwl_DPUeSw6_Uf6K9?usp=sharing)<br>
Not really working when it give an index scores. It gave the score of something else more than the actual sign that I need.<br>

## Milestone 01: Ideation

### Idea 1
[Cat and Dog in Museum](https://monsichasris.github.io/major-studio-1/project01/) - I made this project last semester using data from Smithsonian Museums
I categorized by title or description text provided, but the result is not accurated as much as I hope. Since I didn't know ML back then, Now I know some!
I would like to revisit and use ML to categorized cat and dog in form of art like painting, sculpture etc. to see how much it could be better.
<br><li>**Do you expect to have to do a lot of pre-processing of the data ?** - I don't think so, I can continue use from what I have done.
<br><li>**Does it make sense to have data split into train/test datasets ?** - Yes.. I think some of them clear enough to be a train.
<br><li>**How would you evaluate your model/tool/visualizations ?** - Error check / Score them.

### Idea 2
I would like to try using ML with my thesis [Figjam plan](https://www.figma.com/board/BmwD3vAI49ilARm5Hjtvlb/MSDV-Thesis?node-id=0-1&t=VEDuu5HaAwv5g53Y-1) [Figma mockup](https://www.figma.com/proto/opzcJnmFgAs0uTJeLV0gQa/MSDV-Thesis?page-id=111%3A381&node-id=136-1940&p=f&viewport=793%2C200%2C0.37&t=IweLaJA6QaEFmdzR-1&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&starting-point-node-id=136%3A1940) to detach storefront sign from google street view image and use these image to the next process later. 
At first, I plan not to use ML (and might not use by the end of the actual thesis) but I hope I might found something interesting to explore futher.
<br><li>**Do you expect to have to do a lot of pre-processing of the data ?** - Not a big deal, I have to do for my thesis anyway, which I haven't done yet..
<br><li>**Does it make sense to have data split into train/test datasets ?** - I don't think so, maybe we can do something like egde detection from the sign in image.
<br><li>**How would you evaluate your model/tool/visualizations ?** - Score them like in the example below (Not sure)

### Idea 3
Last one, I just want to play around with the movement or image capture. Something like this project from [Google experiment](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/move-mirror) to predicted the move and create aome kind of art form. Still not sure about this one, but it seems to be the most fun choice to explore.
<br><li>**Do you expect to have to do a lot of pre-processing of the data ?** - I need to find and research more on this data or I could try with one song or 1 video and cut the frame into images.
<br><li>**Does it make sense to have data split into train/test datasets ?** - Maybe not? It could be unsupervised the possible of the movements.
<br><li>**How would you evaluate your model/tool/visualizations ?** - Score them (as always) and maybe it can test with user input
